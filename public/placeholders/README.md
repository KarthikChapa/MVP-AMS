# Placeholders Directory

This directory contains placeholder files for the Athlete Management Platform (AMP):

- `avatar.png` - Default user avatar
- `video-thumbnail.jpg` - Thumbnail for video exercises
- `exercise-1.jpg` through `exercise-8.jpg` - Exercise thumbnails

For video exercises, the platform would normally use real video files, but for the MVP we're 
using placeholders. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual videos 
uploaded by users or provided by trainers.

## Video Exercise Placeholders

For demo purposes, the following video placeholders are referenced:

- `/videos/squat-demo.mp4`
- `/videos/deadlift-demo.mp4`
- `/videos/bench-press-demo.mp4`
- `/videos/shoulder-press-demo.mp4`
- `/videos/rows-demo.mp4`
- `/videos/lunges-demo.mp4`
- `/videos/pull-ups-demo.mp4`
- `/videos/push-ups-demo.mp4`

In the actual implementation, these would be linked to a video storage solution like AWS S3 or a CDN.
